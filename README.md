## What this project is about ##
This is a web application that allows user to publish articles and to download them in different format including HTML, JSON and XML format. I developed this web application as part of an assessment for a *Java Developer* position at [Cefalo](https://www.cefalo.com/en/) in 2016, leading to a job offer from them. It can act as a good short tutorial for candidates anticpating similar positions in industry. 

## Project Structure ##
1. /src/main/resources/ - contains client side code
2. /src/main/resources/templates/ - contains HTML code
3. /src/main/resources/static/ - contains CSS and necessary javascript code
4. /src/main/java/com/cefalo/ - contains server-side code written in spring boot framework of java programming language

## Technology and Frameworks being used in this project ##
1. Spring Boot has the charge of managing server side code
2. In memory SQL database HSQLDB has been used for repository purpose. Data will not be persisted. So
you will lose data every time you restart servlet conatiner.
3. Maven used as build and dependency management tool
4. Template engine Thyemleaf used for HTML rendering
5. For UI design, Bootstrap and Font-awesome has been used

2. Apache Tomcat (Version: 8)
3. JDK (Version: 1.8)
 
## Deploy application in a servlet container ##
1. Clone newsapp project in your machine
2. Go to root directory of the project
3. Open shell and type following command: ./mvnw clean package
4. Go to target directory and copy newsapp.war
5. Paste it to any servlet container. For Tomcat, paste it in webapps folder and start tomcat
6. You should be able to access application in following URL: http://host:port/newsapp/news 
7. Landing page (http://host:port/newsapp/news) shows a list of all the story so far created
8. To add a story, click Add Story menu from top nav bar or paste this URL: http://host:port/newsapp/news/addStory

## Run application with embedded tomcat ##
1. Clone newsapp project in your machine
2. Go to root directory of the project
3. Open shell and type following command: ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
4. Application will be deployed at default port 8080 (If available). 
5. If port 8080 is not available, you can run with port of your choice with command line arguments. 
For example, to run in port 9070, type: ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments="--server.port=9070"
